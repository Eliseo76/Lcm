Least Common Multiple using prime factorization on a array of 2 numbers,  Objective : Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters. The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.  For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that  is also evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.

Well I think I did this the longest way possible, Im still learning but you might get something out of this code. A laugh if anything. :)
